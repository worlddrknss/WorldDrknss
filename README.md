- 🗄 **Database**: PostgreSQL + Redis (sessions, tokens, rate limits)
- 🛰 **Messaging**: NATS-based event-driven architecture (e.g., `trainer.certification.add`, `nutrition-service.createBMR`)
- ☁️ **Infrastructure**: AWS EKS, GitOps pipelines, Cilium network policies, Vault/SOPS secret management
- 📱 **Mobile**: Native Kotlin app with Jetpack Compose, Ktor, Hilt DI, Room DB, and modular architecture
- 🧠 **Observability & Security**: DataDog, CrowdStrike, Upwind, eBPF, default-deny policies

> Motto: _"Probably too hard for you."_
